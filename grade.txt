This is beautiful work.  I wish all of my students put in as much effort as the two of you.  Your language is both creative and useful, and I really enjoyed playing with it.  If the Ward Prize deadline had been a little later (the timing is difficult for spring projects), this would have been an easy nomination for me.  

Aside from the language itself, I love your language documents.  They are easy to read, thorough, and they're just pleasing to look at.  You two should seriously consider becoming language designers!  I think you should be proud of this work.  Would you mind if I used your project as an example the next time I teach CS334?

I would love to see you move this online.  You might check out the Fable project (https://fable.io/).  Markus Feng, one of the 334 TAs, used this project to put his 334 project from fall '18 online.  You might reach out to him to see what steps you need to do.

Well done! Enjoy your summer.
